      <li>1/2 cup (113 g) unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>4 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 cup (240 ml) heavy cream</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons powdered sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Powdered sugar, for dusting (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat your oven to 200°C (400°F) and line a baking sheet with
        parchment paper.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a saucepan, combine water, milk, butter, sugar, and salt. Bring to a
        boil over medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from heat and add flour all at once. Stir vigorously until the
        mixture forms a ball and pulls away from the sides of the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Let the dough cool for 5 minutes, then add eggs one at a time, mixing
        well after each addition until smooth and glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        Transfer the dough to a piping bag and pipe small mounds onto the
        prepared baking sheet.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake for 20–25 minutes or until golden brown and puffed. Let cool
        completely.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whip the heavy cream with powdered sugar and vanilla extract
        until stiff peaks form.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cut the cooled puffs in half and fill with whipped cream. Dust with
        powdered sugar if desired. Serve immediately.
