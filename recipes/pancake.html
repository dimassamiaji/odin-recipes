    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>1 cup milk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>Butter or oil for cooking</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        In another bowl, whisk the milk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla
        extract.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until just
        combined. Do not overmix; some lumps are okay.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a non-stick skillet or griddle over medium heat and lightly grease
        with butter or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour 1/4 cup of batter for each pancake onto the skillet. Cook until
        bubbles form on the surface, then flip and cook until golden brown.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat with the remaining batter. Serve warm with your favorite
        toppings.
